**Day 1: Raw sequence to gene counts**

![](../Figs/1.1_nfcore-rnaseq.png)

- RNA sequencing and its main applications
- Steps in a typical RNA-Seq workflow to process raw RNA-seq data into raw counts.
- Understanding 
    - Quality control of reads
    - Trimming of reads 
    - Alignment to reference
    - Quantification
- Workflow management tools for automated, reproducible, flexible and portable analysis.
- Run the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline and interpret its outputs.


**Day 2: Counts to genes and functional enrichments**

![](../Figs/2.1_Rstudio_chrome_rmd.png)

- Exploratory analysis of the count data for quality control.
- Analyse count data to identify differentially expressed genes.
- Identifying functional enrichments from differentially expressed genes.
- Reproducible analysis using Rstudio with Rmarkdown. 
- Using Singularity containers for portable and reproducible analysis.
