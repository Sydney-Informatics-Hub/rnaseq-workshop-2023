**RNA-seq: reads to differential gene expression**
![](../Figs/2.5_workshop_summary.png)


In this session, we used the count matrix generated by the nfcore-rnaseq pipleine to identify differentially expressed genes and functional enrichments 

## **Takeaways**

### 2.5.1 Exploratory analysis
The principle component analysis shows a good separation of the sample across conditions  
![](../Figs/2.5_PCA.png)

### 2.5.2 Differential expression analysis  
Gtf2ird1 KO showed dysregulation of many genes and many functionally enriched gene ontologies (GO).  
**Total 19,859 genes in mouse genome**.  
  - LFC > 0 (up): 1,353 DE genes (6.8%)    
  - LFC < 0 (down): 984 DE genes (5%)

### 2.5.3 Functional enrichment analysis 
**Total GO enrichments identified from DE genes**.  
  - Categories form Up-regulated genes : 823    
  - Categories form Down-regulated genes : 255

The most significantly enriched GO terms captured high-level biological functions that weren’t all related to our phenotypes of interest. We will go back to the biology to make sense of all these results.     
  
**Which ontologies in the list are relevant to your experiment**    
**Craniofacial development**    
Disorders relate to the bones of the skull (cranio) and face. Lead to distinctive facial features​  
**GO:** Wnt pathway   
Involved in  
- cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion   
- promote the differentiation of skin epithelial cells and the development of hair follicles  
     
**GO:** skin development, epidermis development  

**Cardiovascular abnormalities**       
**GO:** striated muscle tissue development      
**GO:** muscle system process, muscle cell development, muscle cell differentiation       
**GO:** sarcomere organisation      


### 2.5.4 Experimental considerations / limitations. 
- **Experimental design:** Choose the right tissue for the research question.    
- **Number of replicates:** To improve statistical power and overcome any problems due to outliers.       
- **Realistic interpretation** of the results.    


### 2.5.5 Reproducible analysis using Rstudio with Rmarkdown  
We used Singularity containers for portable and reproducible analysis
