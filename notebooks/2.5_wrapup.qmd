In this session, we used the count matrix from the nextflow pipleine to identify differentially expressed genes and functional enrichments 

## **Takeaways**

### **2.5.1 Exploratory analysis of the count data for quality control.
The principle component analysis shows a good separation of the sample across conditions

### **2.5.2 Analyse count data to identify differentially expressed genes.  
Gtf2ird1 KO showed dysregulation of many genes and many functionally enriched gene ontologies (GO).  
**Total 19,859 genes in mouse genome**.  
  - LFC > 0 (up): 1,353 DE genes (6.8%).  
  - LFC < 0 (down): 984 DE genes (5%).  

### **2.5.3 Identify functional enrichments from differentially expressed genes. 

**Total GO enrichments identified from DE genes**.  
  - Categories form Up-regulated genes : 823.  
  - Categories form Down-regulated genes : 255.

**Digging deeper:** Which ontologies in the list are relevant to your experiment
The most significantly enriched GO terms captured high-level biological functions that weren’t all related to our phenotypes of interest. We will go back to the biology to make sense of all these results. 
**Craniofacial development**.  
Disorders relate to the bones of the skull (cranio) and face. Lead to distinctive facial features​  
**GO:** Wnt pathway   
Involved in.  
  -  cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion   
  -  promote the differentiation of skin epithelial cells and the development of hair follicles.  
**GO:** skin development, epidermis development  

**Cardiovascular abnormalities**.   
**GO:** striated muscle tissue development.  
**GO:** muscle system process, muscle cell development, muscle cell differentiation.  
**GO:** sarcomere organisation.  


### **2.5.4 Experimental considerations / limitations. 
- Experimental design: choosing the right tissue for the research question. 
- Number of replicates to improve statistical power; also overcome any problems due to outliers. 
- Interpreting the results realistically. 


### **2.5.5 Reproducible analysis using Rstudio with Rmarkdown.   
- We used Singularity containers for portable and reproducible analysis.
