In this session, we used the count matrix generated by the nfcore-rnaseq pipleine to identify differentially expressed genes and functional enrichments 

## **Takeaways**

### 2.5.1 Exploratory analysis of the count data for quality control.
The principle component analysis shows a good separation of the sample across conditions

### **2.5.2 Analyse count data to identify differentially expressed genes.  
Gtf2ird1 KO showed dysregulation of many genes and many functionally enriched gene ontologies (GO).  
**Total 19,859 genes in mouse genome**.  
  - LFC > 0 (up): 1,353 DE genes (6.8%)    
  - LFC < 0 (down): 984 DE genes (5%)

### 2.5.3 Identify functional enrichments from differentially expressed genes. 

**Total GO enrichments identified from DE genes**.  
  - Categories form Up-regulated genes : 823    
  - Categories form Down-regulated genes : 255

**Which ontologies in the list are relevant to your experiment**  
The most significantly enriched GO terms captured high-level biological functions that weren’t all related to our phenotypes of interest. We will go back to the biology to make sense of all these results.     
**Craniofacial development**    
Disorders relate to the bones of the skull (cranio) and face. Lead to distinctive facial features​  
**GO:** Wnt pathway   
Involved in  
- cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion   
- promote the differentiation of skin epithelial cells and the development of hair follicles  
     
**GO:** skin development, epidermis development  

**Cardiovascular abnormalities**       
**GO:** striated muscle tissue development      
**GO:** muscle system process, muscle cell development, muscle cell differentiation       
**GO:** sarcomere organisation      


### 2.5.4 Experimental considerations / limitations. 
- Experimental design: choosing the right tissue for the research question   
- Number of replicates to improve statistical power; also overcome any problems due to outliers   
- Interpreting the results realistically  


### 2.5.5 Reproducible analysis using Rstudio with Rmarkdown  
We used Singularity containers for portable and reproducible analysis
