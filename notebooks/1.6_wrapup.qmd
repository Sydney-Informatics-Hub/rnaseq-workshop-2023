In this session, we performed the necessary data pre-processing steps required for differential expression with RNAseq data. We used the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline to process raw data from fastq inputs, align sequence reads, generate gene counts and perform extensive quality control. This pipeline is built using Nextflow, which is a bioinformatics workflow management tool that supports reproducibile, portable, and scalable analyses.

## **Takeaways**

The main takeaways from the first session of this workshop are:
