We used the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline to process raw data from fastq inputs, align sequence reads, generate gene counts and perform extensive quality control. This pipeline is built using Nextflow, which is a bioinformatics workflow management tool that supports reproducibile, portable, and scalable analyses.

## **Takeaways**


The main takeaways from the first session of this workshop are:
