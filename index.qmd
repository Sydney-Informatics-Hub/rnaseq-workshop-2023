This workshop series will introduce you to RNA sequencing data analysis for differential expression and functional enrichment on the command line. We will use the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline to process raw sequence reads to a gene count matrix and then perform differential expression and enrichment analyses with R/Rstudio.

## Target audience{.unlisted}

This workshop series is suitable for people who are familiar with working at command line interface and may be new to RNAseq for differential expression analysis. The course is beginner friendly and intended for those interested in using the command line interface for their analysis. It is also suitable for those who want to learn about and use nf-co.re workflows.

## Prerequisites{.unlisted}

* Familiarity with Unix/Linux command line
* Familiarity with R/RStudio
* [Introduction to RNAseq webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITR3WR_jWI) ([slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8323207))

## Get the most out of this workshop{.unlisted}

This workshop series is presented across 2 days and will consist of code-along and breakout room sessions. You will get the most out of the workshop if you:

* Brush up on your command line basics before Day 1
* Brush up on your R/Rstudio skills
* Watch our webinar introducing RNAseq experiments 
* Set up your computer before Day 1
* Use the Slack channel to ask questions and engage in discussions during the workshop
* Do the provided exercises during the workshop
