As PC1 and PC2 explain most of the variance observed in the dataset, we do not check the other PCs.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the other PCs is something you may want to do until you have explored most of the variation in the dataset and what their potential sources might be. We will not have time to cover this in the workshop, but do recommend you look into scree plots and observing the genes contributing to each PC."

This will ensure our analysis is reproducible by our future selves and others. By tracking the results output by each stage of the workflow, we can track potential issues with out data or the parameters we are using as well as identify things like contamination or biases that may impede our downstream analyses.\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline generates comprehensive QC stats for all steps. These metrics are all aggregated into a single report using MultiQC. MultiQC is a popular tool for aggregating quality control metrics output by a number of popular bioinformatics tools. It generates interactive reports and outputs them as .html files that can be viewed with a web browser.\n➤ We have previously looked through MultiQC report in this session, but lets take a closer look in this lesson. Open the MultiQC report created at the end of our post-QC pipeline execution.\n/home/training/Day-1/WBS-mouse-results/multiqc/star_salmon/multiqc_report.html\nOn the left hand side, you will see a number of sections and subsections. The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline runs lots of different tools throughout the workflow to identify possible issues that may affect downstream analysis and summarise the results of each process your sequence data is run through.

We will use this feature to save ourselves time and pick up from after read trimming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNextflow resume function explained\n\n\n\nOne of Nextflow’s key features is the ability to resume a workflow from the point of failure, rather than starting over from scratch. When running any Nextflow workflow, you can use the -resume flag to use this feature.\nNextflow uses a caching system to track the results of each task in a workflow. This cache will include both the input files and output files created for each task. If your workflow execution is interrupted for any reason, some tasks may have completed while others have not. Using -resume tells Nextflow to check the cache to see which tasks have already finishe. Notice the appearance of a work directory when you run your Nextflow pipelines. For tasks that were not completed or quit with an error, it will attempt to rerun them.\n\n\n➤ In your terminal, check where you are by running:\npwd\n/home/training/Day-1\nIf you are not in the Day-1 directory, move into it by running:\ncd /home/training/Day-1 \nWe are going to adjust our run command slightly from last time, note:\n\nThe -resume flag at the end of the command\nWe will output our results in a different directory (--outdir)\nWe have added an extra flag to skip duplicate marking (--skip_markduplicates)\n\nNote that we have not specified a read alignment or quantification tool. We will be running the default setting which runs STAR to map the raw fastq reads to the reference genome and perform the read quantification using the alignment files with Salmon. You can specify which alignment method you’d like to use with --aligner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on duplicate marking in RNAseq data\n\n\n\nBy default, the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline uses picard to mark the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples. Unless you are using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) it is not possible to establish whether your duplicate sequence reads are true biological duplication or PCR bias introduced during the library preparation.\nGiven our data hasn’t been tagged with UMIs, we won’t be able to accurately remove artifact duplicates from the alignments. Therefore we don’t need to worry about tagging them.\n\n\n➤ Execute the following:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq_3.12.0/3_12_0/main.nf \\\n    --input ~/Data/samplesheet.csv \\\n    --outdir WBS-mouse-results \\\n    --fasta ~/Data/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.fa \\\n    --gtf ~/Data/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.gtf \\\n    --star_index ~/Data/mm10_reference/STAR \\\n    --salmon_index ~/Data/mm10_reference/salmon-index \\\n    -profile singularity \\\n    --skip_markduplicates \\\n    --max_memory '6.GB' \\\n    --max_cpus 2 -resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on reference genome indexing\n\n\n\nToday we are using a pre-indexed reference genome (--star_index and --salmon_index) we prepared for you. Index files are required for tools like our aligners to run faster. Think of it like the index at the back of a textbook, where you can easily find what pages certain words are on.\nNote that indexing requires a lot of memory and can be slow, so if you didn’t have a prepared index and you needed nf-core/rnaseq to perform indexing, you would need to increase memory (--max_memory).\n\n\nThe progress of the workflow will be displayed in the terminal and updated in real-time.

Take a look at the nf-core/rnaseq usage instructions to determine what is right for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints for running nf-core on your infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\nNextflow allows us to set our configuration needs within a custom configuration file and apply it to our execution command using the -c flag.\nSomeone may have already built and shared a configuration file specifically for your infrastructure, like this config we built for Pawsey’s Nimbus instances. These pre-built, infrastructure specific configs are called Institutional configs and they can be downloaded with the pipeline code base and applied to all nf-core pipelines.\nInstitutional configs help us create efficient workflows that can be shared with others to reproducibly run the workflow in the same computational environment.\n\n\n\nOnce the pipeline has successfully completed, you will again see a message printed to your terminal that outlines how long it took your pipeline to run, how many tasks were executed, and how many of those tasks were cached:\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully -\nCompleted at: 29-Sep-2023 03:55:58\nDuration    : 15m 12s\nCPU hours   : 0.4 (14.5% cached)\nSucceeded   : 153\nCached      : 17\n➤ We will explore the outputs in depth in the next lessons.

This is mainly instructions or an explanation of the R code blocks that follow:\n\nFeel free to add your own notes and save a copy of this file\n\n\nFor more details on using R Markdown see here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are only working from the .Rmd!!\n\n\n\nThis webpage will contain the same R code as is in rnaseq_DE_analysis_Day2.Rmd. You are welcome to use and modify this webpage’s code for your own future experiments, but during today, we will be working from RStudio and the .Rmd file only."

    "text": "1.1.4 Introduction to nf-core/rnaseq\nnf-core is a community-curated collection of bioinformatics pipelines written in Nextflow. The nf-core community is global, comprising bioinformaticians, computational biologists, software engineers, and biologists. The community works together to develop and maintain best practice bioinformatics pipelines and support others in running them. They’ve also developed a toolkit to assist in pipeline usage and development. Everyone is welcome to join the community!\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline can be used to analyse RNA sequencing data obtained from organisms with a reference genome and annotated gene dataset. It is flexible and modular, allowing users to choose which processes to run and giving users the choice of different tools for essential steps like read alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are we running a pipeline?\n\n\n\n\n\nBioinformatics workflows are like wet-lab protocols, they consist of many steps that need to be performed consistently across experiments. And just like wet-lab protocols, things can get very complicated very quickly when we’re working with different numbers of samples, different organisms, and collaborating with other researchers. Just take a look at the image below to see how messy things can get!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can nf-core/rnaseq do?\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is designed to handle data processing steps that can easily be standardised and automated. It is used to process the raw sequence reads and generate read count data that we will be analysing tomorrow. These steps are often the most computationally challenging to perform. Users can run their data through the whole pipeline with one command, or specific stages.\nLooking at the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline structure below, we can see that the developers have:\n\nOrganised the workflow into 5 stages based on the type of work that is being done\nProvided a choice of multiple methods and specified defaults\nProvided a choice of tool for some steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I run the pipeline?\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven Nextflow’s focus on portability and reproducibility, the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline can be run on any compute environment where you can install Nextflow and one of the software management tools like Singularity, Docker, or Conda (among others). Take a look at their installation guide for more details.\nKeep in mind that each of the tools the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline uses has its own minimum compute resource requirements. This means you’ll need to make sure the environment you’re working on has enough RAM and CPUs to process your data and disk space to store your raw data, intermediate files, and final results. Given how greedy these processes can be, we usually recommend you don’t work on your personal computer."

For the sake of responsible research and reproducibility, we recommend always downloading a copy of the code base when working with nf-core pipelines.\n\nGet familiar with the nf-core/rnaseq run command\n➤ You can see the recommended (typical) run command and all the parameters available for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline either at their parameters page or by running:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq_3.12.0/3_12_0/main.nf --help \nYou will see a message displayed on your screen with the name of the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, a recommended run command, and a big list of parameters.\n\nLook at all the different parameters! We won’t be using most of these today as we’ll be running the default workflow. nf-core has extensive documentation that you should always use to determine whether it is suitable for your applications, construct a run command, and understand its outputs.\nAs you can see from the typical run command printed when you ran the help command, we need to provide the pipeline with some essential parameters and inputs. Our run command specifies some extra details that we will explore in depth later, but for now the minimum requirements for running the pipeline are:\n\nAn input sample sheet containing paths to our raw sequence reads (fastq files)\nA location to save the results directory to\nThe reference data we are working with\nA software management tool, we will be using Singularity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection exercise\n\n\n\nTake a look at the nf-core/rnaseq instructions on building a samplesheet. Compare our samplesheet to the nf-core example, what differences do you notice?\nView our prepared samplesheet.csv by running:\ncat ~/Data/samplesheet.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth sample sheets contain 6 samples. However, the example samplesheet consists of both single- and paired-end data for the control samples and TREATMENT_REP3 has been sequenced twice.\nOur sample sheet is more simple, with only single-end reads. Note that the column for the reverse-reads is empty in our sample sheet.\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with our working space and our pipeline, we are going to run the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline in two stages:\n\nRaw data quality control\nAlignment and quantification\n\nThe mouse genome is large and contains ~20,000 genes which would take hours to process. For the sake of expediency, we are running the pre-processing workflow on a subset of the whole mouse genome for both of these stages. Tomorrow we will provide you with a whole genome count matrix, to perform differential expression and enrichment analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\n\n\n\nRNAseq for differential expression experiments can be used to gain insights into active biological processes in the studied tissue.\nThe standard RNAseq experimental workflow comprises multiple steps performed in the wet lab and bioinformatically or computationally.\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is a powerful tool to process RNAseq data, as it offers a standardised and automated approach to handle computationally challenging tasks."

Basically, just open your preferred terminal program and off you go!\n\n\nOS X (Mac)\nMac operating systems come with a terminal program, called Terminal. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit Command + Space and type ‘terminal’. You may find that other, 3rd party terminal programs are more user-friendly and powerful, like Iterm2.\n\n\nWindows\nWe recommend MobaXterm, which offers a rich experience as a full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for ssh connections, the free version is more than adequate.\nTo install and start using MobaXterm:\n\nGo to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html\nUnder ‘Home Edition’ select the Download now button\nSelect the MobaXterm Home Edition (Installer edition)\nOnce the program is downloaded, install it as you would any other windows program\nOnce the program is installed, start the MobaXterm program\nFrom this screen, click on ‘start local terminal’ (and install Cygwin if prompted)\n\n\n\n\nLogin via Terminal\nTo log in to Nimbus, we will use a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. To connect, you need 3 things:\n\nThe assigned IP address of your instance (i.e. 146.118.XXX.XX). Each participant will be provided with their instance’s IP address at the beginning of the workshop.\nYour login name. In our case, this will be training for all participants.\nYour password. All participants will be provided with a password at the beginning of the workshop.\n\nTo log in: type the following into your terminal, using your allocated instance’s IP address:\nssh training@146.118.XXX.XX\nYou will receive a message saying:\nThe authenticity of host '146.118.XX.XXX (146.118.XX.XXX)' can't be established.\nRemember your host address will be different than the one above. There will then be a message saying:\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\nIf you would like to skip this message next time you log in, answer ‘yes’. It will then give a warning:\nWarning: Permanently added '146.118.XX.XXX' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\nEnter the password provided at the beginning of the workshop. Ask one of the demonstrators if you’ve forgotten it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention\n\n\n\nWhen you type a password on the terminal, there will not be any indication the password is being entered. You’ll not see a moving cursor, or even any asterisks, or bullets. That is an intentional security mechanism used by all terminal applications and can trip us up sometimes, so be careful when typing or copying your password in.\n\n\nHaving successfully logged in, your terminal should then display something like that shown in the figure below:"

    "text": "1.4.1 Alignment of reads to a reference genome\nThe output we will be examining in this lesson is output by the second stage of the nf-core/rnaseq workflow: read alignment and quantification (red box below).\n\nAfter read trimming, the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline maps reads to a reference genome specified by the user using STAR. Keep in mind that RNAseq specific alignment tools are different from whole genome alignment tools. They are designed to be ‘splice aware’, meaning they are capable of differentiating intronic from exonic regions in the alignment process.\nBulk RNA-seq reads are derived from mature mRNA and contain only exons (and no introns). This means a sequence read can span 2 exons. Splice-aware aligners use a reference genome, not a transcriptome to perform read alignment, which contain intergenic, intronic and exonic sequences. This means that when they’re aligned to the reference genome, RNA-seq reads might span large introns. Splice aware aligners, like STAR know not to align the RNA-seq reads to introns and can align a read across exons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetics 101 refresher: mRNA splicing\n\n\n\nmRNA splicing is the process by which an mRNA transcript prepares to be translated into an amino acid sequence. It works by removing introns and splicing all exons back together to create a mature mRNA that is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, ready to undergo translation.\n\n\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline offers us various alignment and quantification routes:\n\nSTAR – Salmon\nSTAR – RSEM\nHISAT2 – no quantification\n\nAligned sequences for each sample are output in the bam file format. STAR (Spliced Transcript Alignment to a Reference) is a very popular RNAseq alignment tool. It has previously been shown to be more accurate and efficient than other popular RNAseq alignment tools.\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline has been written in a way where all the files generated from the alignment step onwards (except the summary report) are saved to the same directory as specified by --aligner. In our case, you will find the output alignment files in star_salmon:\nls -lh WBS-mouse-results/star_salmon/*.bam*\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.7M Sep 29 03:45 SRR3473984.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  51K Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473984.sorted.bam.bai\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.4M Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473985.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  50K Sep 29 03:47 SRR3473985.sorted.bam.bai\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.3M Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473986.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  52K Sep 29 03:47 SRR3473986.sorted.bam.bai\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.4M Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473987.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  53K Sep 29 03:48 SRR3473987.sorted.bam.bai\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 4.3M Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473988.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  53K Sep 29 03:47 SRR3473988.sorted.bam.bai\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.1M Sep 29 03:46 SRR3473989.sorted.bam\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  49K Sep 29 03:48 SRR3473989.sorted.bam.bai\nNotice above we have both alignment files (.bam) and their index files (.bam.bai). Index files are commonly created for large bioinformatics files to allow for rapid querying. These index files are just like the index at the back of a book. They are used by software to quickly find the location of a specific region without having to scan the whole file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarking duplicate reads in RNAseq data\n\n\n\nBy default, the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline uses picard’s MarkDuplicates to mark the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples.\nRecall that we applied the --skip_markduplicates parameter. This is because it is not recommended to remove duplicates from RNAseq data because you expect a significant level of true biological duplication that arises from the same fragments being sequenced repeatedly.\n\n\n➤ Let’s take a look at how our aligner and quantification tools performed. Take a look at the alignment scores in the MultiQC summary report generated by the pipeline, you’ll find it at:\n/home/training/Day-1/WBS-mouse-results/multiqc/star_salmon/multiqc_report.html\n\n\nAs expected, our alignments performed well. Most of the reads in all of our samples were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome and only small proportion were unmapped."

Visualising alignments around genomic regions of interest can be a reliable way to identify potential problems like contamination, biases, or technical artefacts. Let’s take a quick look at how alignments work, using the IGV output below. IGV has helpful documentation regarding the visualisation of RNAseq alignments.\n\n➤ Take a look at the IGV image below. We have zoomed in to the first three exon in our gene of interest, Gtf2ird1. Looking at the read depth track, we can see the vast majority of our reads have aligned to exons (purple), but there are some tiny bumps between exons. This may be an indication of some DNA contamination or misalignment of reads in our samples. Nothing to be concerned about though.\n\n➤ Take a look at the IGV image below. It covers one exon of our gene of interest, Gtf2ird1. If you compare it to the annotated screenshots above, you can see we have zoomed into the region spanning just the first exon (chr5:134417034-134417200) in the mm10 assembly. We can see both the read depth and alignment tracks much clearer. Note that reads only span the exons, they do not continue into the introns. Ths is because the STAR aligner is splice-aware. This means it recognises and aligns reads across splicing junctions, allowing us to capture exon-exon junctions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge exercise\n\n\n\nWe forgot to label the conditional groupings of our samples and we don’t know which samples belong to the wildtype and knockout groups! Can you use the alignment files above to assign samples to their correct treatment group?\nHint: From the case study, we know a loss of function mutation of Gtf2ird1 was generated by an insertion of a Myc transgene, resulting in a 40 kb deletion surrounding an exon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the gene in the mm10 assembly (chr5:134332897-134481480)\nSamples SRR3473984, SRR3473985, SRR3473984 contain reads covering exon 1.

We can then use these count files (called a gene-count matrix), to identify differentially expressed genes. By default, the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline runs Salmon for transcript quantification, but users have other quantification options.\nSalmon is another popular RNAseq tool, it can take a set of target transcripts to perform quantification. The primary output of Salmon is the quantification results, and these results are provided in different formats and levels of aggregation.\n➤ Take a look at the Salmon outputs for a single sample, SRR3473984:\nls -lh /home/training/WBS-mouse-results/star_salmon/SRR3473984\ntotal 248K\ndrwxrwxr-x  5 training training 4.0K Sep 29 03:46 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 17 training training 4.0K Sep 29 03:55 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 training training 4.0K Sep 29 03:46 aux_info\n-rw-rw-r--  1 training training  265 Sep 29 03:46 cmd_info.json\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 training training 4.0K Sep 29 03:46 libParams\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 training training 4.0K Sep 29 03:46 logs\n-rw-rw-r--  1 training training  49K Sep 29 03:46 quant.genes.sf\n-rw-rw-r--  1 training training 172K Sep 29 03:46 quant.sf\nNote the quant.sf and quant.genes.sf files. quant.sf provides quantification at the transcript level. That is, each row in this file corresponds to a specific transcript, and the reported quantities are the estimated abundances of these transcripts.\nquant.genes.sf provides quantification at the gene level. That is, the abundances of individual transcripts are aggregated to their respective genes, and each row corresponds to a gene. This aggregation is useful for downstream analyses that require gene-level, rather than transcript-level, quantifications.\nMerged, multi-sample count matrix files (tab separated values or TSV format) for both gene and transcript level counts are also produced by the workflow.\nThese raw counts are not a simple count of depth of reads, there is a lot more to consider and each tool does this slightly differently (e.g. how do you count reads spanning overlapping exons across two different genes?). See the Salmon documentation for an explanation of how Salmon does it - this count is an estimation.\n\nWhen to use quant.sf vs quant.genes.sf\nIf you are interested in differential transcript usage, alternative splicing, or transcript-level analyses, you would use the quant.sf file.\nIf you are performing gene-level differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, or other analyses that operate on a gene-centric level, the quant.genes.sf would be more appropriate.\nWe’ll be working with the quant.genes.sf file. It is a tab-separated file containing the read counts for genes.

    "text": "1.2.3 Read trimming\nTrimming is sometimes performed to improve the quality of the raw data and potentially improve its mapability when it is being aligned to a reference genome. There are several ways to perform trimming:\n\nRemoval of poor quality reads or bases (e.g. ends of reads)\nRemoval of adapter sequences\nRemoval of polyA tails\n\nThe nf-core/rnaseq pipeline uses Trim Galore for read quality trimming. It is able to perform quality-based removal of low-quality bases and adapter trimming. Given trimming can result in some reads being significantly shortened (sometimes to 0bp!), Trim Galore will filter reads that are too short to be used in downstream processes like read alignment. We are still looking at the outputs from the first part of the nf-core/rnaseq workflow below (red box).\n\n\nDoes trimming help?\nRead trimming is not always a necessary step when processing next generation sequencing (NGS) data. These days, NGS data is of a very high quality and the tools we use to perform processes like read mapping are capable of handling poor quality reads and adapter sequences.\nWhile the trimming adapter sequences has been shown to increase the quality of RNA-seq data (Dozmorov et al., 2015), other studies have shown that trimming of poor quality reads can effect gene expression estimates (Williams at el., 2016).\nWhen making the decision to trim your reads for differential expression RNAseq studies, we suggest following the recommendations of the read alignment tool you’ll be using. We will explore trimming outcomes.\n➤ Open your Nimbus terminal again to do the challenge exercise below. Navigate to the results directory either on the command line or using your VS Code File Explorer and answer the following questions:\ncd ~/Day-1/WBS-mouse-QC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection exercise\n\n\n\n\nWhich tool does nfcore-rnaseq use for read-trimming?\nWhich tool did you use to generate quality reports before and after trimming?\nWhat effect did trimming have on SRR3473989.fastq?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrim galore.\nFastQC generates .html reports.\nTotal number of sequences have reduced after trimming. Read length is now 21 - 101. Per base sequence quality now mostly in the green.\n\nOpen trimgalore report by running:\ncat WBS-mouse-QC/trimgalore/SRR3473984.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\n\n\n\nQuality control is fundamental in RNAseq experiments to identify any issues that might skew analysis and interpretation.\nThe Fastq file format is the primary format used for raw sequencing data. Each entry in a Fastq file has a sequence identifier, the nucleotide sequence itself, a separator, and a base call quality score (Phred score) for each nucleotide.\nRead trimming is a process where certain portions of the raw sequence data are removed to enhance its quality and improve its mappability during alignment. The decision to trim reads in an RNAseq experiment should be based on the recommendations of the alignment tool used and the quality of your data."

Your choice to trim reads will depend on their quality, presence of adapter sequences, and read alignment tool of choice. Over-trimming or unnecessary trimming can sometimes remove valuable sequence information, so it’s essential to strike a balance.\nRNAseq read alignment is splice-aware, meaning that it’s designed to identify and handle reads that span exon-exon junctions. This capability ensures that such reads are accurately mapped, providing a true representation of the transcriptome.\nRead quantification to create a count matrix for your samples is required for differential expression analysis. Proper quantification will ensure that RNA abundance is accurately represented.\nDifferent alignment and quantification tools and methods suit different applications. These tools will have different underlying models and assumptions that will be reflected in their outputs."

    "text": "2.3.3 Perform differential expression analysis\nBefore we commence with DE, there are some key concepts that you should know:\n\nEach sample is sequenced to a slightly different depth and this needs to be normalised (if we have 60 million reads for sample A but 30 million for sample B, it does not mean that all of sample A’s genes are expressed twice as high!)\nRNA-Seq data count data is distributed in a heteroskedatic manner - in other words, the amount of variance changes with the mean. Lowly expressed genes tend to have a higher read count variance than highly expressed genes. This violates the assumption of most statistical models which assume homoskedatic data. Therefore, the data needs to be transformed.\nDifferential expression tests are performed for every single gene. If we use a simple P < 0.05 cut-off value, 1,000 genes will be defined as DE by chance for a species with ~20,000 genes (humans and mice). Therefore, we need to reduce and adjust for multiple testing.\n\nAll DE methods account for the above in their own way. In this workshop, we will use and explore DESeq2’s method.\n\nVarious Normalization Methods\n\nDESeq2: Size Factor Normalization - Estimates size factors to account for library size and sequencing depth.\nedgeR: Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) - Estimates normalization factors based on the most stably expressed genes.\nlimma-voom: Voom Transformation - Transforms count data to log2 counts per million (logCPM) and applies linear modeling.\nCuffdiff/Cufflinks: Quartile Normalization - Scales data based on upper quartile normalization to correct for library size differences."

A positive value indicates that the KO expression was higher than Wild (remember the fuss about setting factor levels?).

We will explore a few plots and concepts to better understand what is happening under the hood.\n\nMA plot\nThe MA plot provides an overview of the relationship between significantly differentially expressed genes, gene expression and log fold change in the form of a scatter plot. Each dot on the plot represents a single gene, significant genes are coloured as a blue dot. The average gene expression is on the x axis (expressed as a mean of normalized counts) and the log fold change is on the Y axis.\n# There is another R function called plotMA, so we need to specify to use DESeq2's plotMA\nDESeq2::plotMA(res, ylim = c(-12, 12))\nThere are a few things we notice:\n\nGenes that are differentially expressed will appear as points deviating significantly from the centerline, with those above the line indicating upregulated genes and those below indicating downregulated genes.\nGenes with a lower mean expression have higher variable log fold changes (heteroskedatic - as we expected)\nGene expression is symmetrical around log fold change 0\n\n\n\nHistogram of P-values\nRemember that for every gene, we perform a statistical test to determine whether gene expression is significantly different in the knockout samples, compared to the wildtype. This results in thousands (~20,000 genes in the mouse genome) of p-values. We can look at the histogram of p-values to see how our well our statistical test behaves before we apply correction for multiple testing.\n# Bin frequency of p-value counts by 0.05 incremets (i.e plot 20 columns from p-value of 0 to 1)\nhist(res$pvalue, \n     breaks = 20, \n     col = \"grey\")\nA nice histogram of p-values will have a peak at the 0.05 end, and a uniform frequency at all other p-value bins. Think back to your null and alternate hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis, there is a 5% chance of genes will fall under p-value 0.05, 10 % for p-value under 0.1, etc. The high peak at the first bin (p-value 0 - 0.5) represents genes that reject the null hypothesis (in addition to all the false discoveries - hence our need to adjust for multiple testing!).\nA histogram of p-values that looks anything other than what is described above means that something weird has happened and you may need to contact your local statistician/bioinformatician.\nThis blog post has a nice explanation of each scenario if you want to explore this further.\n\n\n\nAdditional plots\n\nDispersion estimates\nThe dispersion plot is useful to examine whether your data is meeting DESeq2’s assumptions around heteroskedasticity and that the data fits DESeq2’s model well. Dispersion is how DESeq2 quantifies variability in the data. It considers variance and mean expression within each experimental group.\nLet’s use plotDispEsts() to generate the dispersion plot and discuss what this means.\n# Plot dispersion estimates using dds\n# Note - we have set our experimental design to ~ condition and it is using this to estimate dispersion\nplotDispEsts( dds)\nThere are a few things to note:\n\nDispersion is higher for genes with small mean of normalized counts, and lower for genes with high mean of normalized counts.\n\nIf you see any other trend, this is a sign that you should not trust DESeq2’s results and that you need to investigate further\n\nTo transform the data, we need to use the variation observed within each experimental group. We cannot do this accurately with few biological replicates (e.g n =3 for KO, n = 3 for wildtype).\n\nDESeq2 assumes that genes with similar expression have a similar level of dispersion to get a more accurate estimation of variability - one of its many benefits! A model (the red curve) is calculated by DESeq2 with this information, using a method called shrinkage.\nIn other words, the red line represents the expected dispersion for any given level of expression\n\nThe black dots represent each gene and their own dispersion (using within group variance as described above)\nThe gene-wise dispersion estimate (black dots) need to be shrunken towards the red line. This helps to reduce false positive results in our differential expression analysis\n\nThere is a lot happening here, but the main point is that our dispersion plot looks as expected and plots should generally appear like this. Check this website for a deeper explanation of this concept, and for examples of what bad dispersion plots look like."

Your choice to trim reads will depend on their quality, presence of adapter sequences, and read alignment tool of choice. Over-trimming or unnecessary trimming can sometimes remove valuable sequence information, so it’s essential to strike a balance.\nRNAseq read alignment is splice-aware, meaning that it’s designed to identify and handle reads that span exon-exon junctions. This capability ensures that such reads are accurately mapped, providing a true representation of the transcriptome.\nRead quantification to create a count matrix for your samples is required for differential expression analysis. Proper quantification will ensure that RNA abundance is accurately represented.\nDifferent alignment and quantification tools and methods suit different applications. These tools will have different underlying models and assumptions that will be reflected in their outputs."
